			<h2>What is Fimfl?</h2>
			<p>FIMFL is an anonymous cryptocurrency based on CryptoNote and Bytecoin. It is a mineable cryptocurrency that uses CryptoNight. It has a block and difficulty target time of 1 minute, smoothly adjusting block rewards, and a coin emission cap of 1,200,000,000 (of which over 99% of total supply will be mined within 10 years).</p>
			<p>Ring signatures keep the sender and receiver keys private, making transactions untraceable and the blockchain analysis resistant.</p>

				<p>CryptoNight is an egalitarian proof-of-work algorithm that favors central processing units (CPUs) and graphics processing units (GPUs) while being resistant to application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs). The algorithm makes use of Keccak, 64-bit multiplication, AES encryptions, and the hash functions: BLAKE, Gr√∏stl, JH, Skein.</p>
